## Pinylib-RTC

**Officially unmaintained 1/2018**

WebRTC module for tinychat chat rooms.

This is the WebRTC version of pinylib. The structure and the coding style is the same as the original pinylib. Since tinychat is still in beta stage, this version should also be seen as a sort of beta version.

It was based on the [POC](https://github.com/notnola/TcRTC) by [notnola](https://github.com/notnola)


## Setting up

Examples shown here, assumes you are using windows.

pinylib-rtc was developed using [python 2.7.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ "python for windows") so this is the recomended python interpreter. Later versions of python should work to, aslong as they are from the 2.7 family. I have not tested it with python 3, but with a few changes to client.py i think it would be possible.

### Requirements

pinylib-rtc requires 4 libraries that are not part of the standard python library, these being:

* [websocket-client](https://github.com/websocket-client/websocket-client)
* [requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests "requests")
* [colorama](https://github.com/tartley/colorama "Colorama")
* [BeautifulSoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/ "beautifulsoup4")

These can all be installed form a command prompt with pip.

`pip install websocket-client requests colorama beautifulsoup4`


## Run the client

Run the client by typing `python path\to\client.py` in a command prompt.
